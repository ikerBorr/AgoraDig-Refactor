      summary: Authenticate user
      description: |
        Authenticates a user using their identifier (email or username) and password. Creates a session on successful authentication.
        
        ## Supported Identifiers
        
        The `identifier` field accepts two types:
        
        - **Email Address** ‚Äî Validated by the Email Value Object (RFC 5322 compliant)
        - **Username** ‚Äî Validated by the Username Value Object (alphanumeric, 3-20 characters)
        
        The system automatically detects the identifier type and applies appropriate validation rules.
        
        ## Security Features
        
        - **Secure Password Hashing** ‚Äî Bcrypt with cost factor 10
        - **Enumeration Prevention** ‚Äî Generic error messages
        - **Rate Limiting** ‚Äî 5 attempts per 15 minutes (planned)
        - **Audit Logging** ‚Äî All login attempts logged (planned)
        
        ## Rate Limiting
        
        **Status:** üü° Planned
        
        - **Limit:** 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
        - **Headers:** `X-RateLimit-*` returned in response
        - **429 Response:** Returned when limit exceeded

            **Bad Request ‚Äî Schema Validation Error**
            
            **Layer:** Schema Validation (Zod)
            
            The request body failed validation before reaching application logic. This indicates a malformed request that doesn't match the expected schema.
            
            ### Common Causes
            
            - Missing required fields (`identifier` or `password`)
            - Invalid data types (e.g., number instead of string)
            - Malformed JSON body
            - Empty strings where values are required
            - Field length constraints violated

          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ValidationErrorResponse'

            **Unauthorized ‚Äî Invalid Credentials**
            
            **Layer:** Application
            
            Authentication failed because the provided credentials do not match any valid user account.
            
            ### Common Causes
            
            - Incorrect password for existing user
            - Non-existent user account
            - Typo in email or username
            - Case-sensitive password mismatch
            
            ### Security Note
            
            The response is intentionally generic to prevent **user enumeration attacks**. The system does not reveal whether the identifier exists or if only the password is incorrect.

            **Conflict ‚Äî Application Policy Violation**
            
            **Layer:** Application
            
            The request conflicts with the current state of the application or violates a business rule. Credentials may be correct, but the account cannot authenticate due to policy restrictions.
            
            ### Common Scenarios
            
            - User account has been banned or suspended
            - Account locked due to multiple failed login attempts
            -Ô∏è Account pending email verification
            -  User in a state that prevents authentication

            **Unprocessable Entity ‚Äî Domain Validation Error**
            
            **Layer:** Domain
            
            The request data violates domain-level validation rules enforced by Value Objects. This indicates that while the data passed schema validation, it fails business logic constraints.
            
            ### Common Scenarios
            
            - Invalid email format (fails Email Value Object validation)
            - Invalid username format or length constraints
            - Password does not meet complexity requirements
            - Domain-specific business rules violated
            
            ### Domain Validation Rules
            
            **Email:**
            - Must be valid RFC 5322 format
            - TLD must be at least 2 characters
            - Cannot contain special characters in local part
            
            **Username:**
            - Alphanumeric characters only
            - Length: 3-20 characters
            - No special characters allowed
            
            **Password:**
            - Minimum 8 characters
            - Must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, special char

            An unexpected error occurred on the server. This is a catch-all for unhandled exceptions that escaped the normal error handling flow.
            
            ### Common Causes
            
            - Database connection failure
            -  External service timeout
            - Unhandled exception in business logic
            - Infrastructure or configuration issues
            - Out of memory or disk space
            
            **Note:** These errors should not occur in normal operation and are treated as high-priority incidents.

            Use these codes in your application for:
            - Error handling logic
            - User-friendly error messages
            - Retry strategies
            - Logging and monitoring
            
            **Important:** Do not parse error messages for logic. Always use error codes.
